# Packages

Platform packages for Rune Icons. Most of them are JavaScript packages in the root pnpm workspace (`packages/*`), so one `pnpm install` at the repository root installs them. `runeicons-react-native` and `runeicons-flutter` are excluded from the workspace and keep their own toolchains.

## Packages

`runeicons-flutter` uses the same name as the npm `runeicons` package, but it is published to a different registry.

## Which package should I use

- **Plain JavaScript or TypeScript, or a framework not listed below**: use `runeicons`. `buildSvg` returns an SVG string you can insert anywhere.
- **React (including Next.js with React)**: use `runeicons-react`.
- **Vue 3**: use `runeicons-vue`.
- **Svelte 5 (including SvelteKit)**: use `runeicons-svelte`.
- **Astro**: use `runeicons-astro`.
- **React Native**: use `runeicons-react-native`, which needs `react-native-svg`.
- **Flutter**: use `runeicons` from pub.dev.
- **AI agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code and other MCP clients)**: run `runeicons-mcp`. It gives agents search and get-icon tools. See its README for client configuration.
- **Editing in VS Code**: install the `runeicons-vscode` extension. It is a private package, so it is not on npm.
- **Designing in Figma**: install the `runeicons-figma` plugin. It is a private package, so it is not on npm.
- **Brand logos (OpenAI, React, Stripe and so on)**: `runeicons-react` (`runeicons-react/brands`), `runeicons-mcp` (`search_brands` and `get_brand`), `runeicons-figma` (the Brands tab) and `runeicons-flutter` (`RuneBrand`) include them. For any other platform, use `runeicons-brands`.

Brand logos are other companies' trademarks, shown for identification only. They are not covered by Rune Icons' Apache 2.0 license, and each keeps its own license. See `public/brand-logos/NOTICE.md`.

The framework packages (`runeicons-react`, `runeicons-vue`, `runeicons-svelte`, `runeicons-astro`) each export a `RuneIcon` component with the same `name`, `type` and `size` props. Their helpers have the same names as the ones in `runeicons`, but the signatures differ. See each package's README.

## Running tests

From the repository root (the JavaScript packages use [Bun](https://bun.sh) in their test scripts, so install Bun as well as pnpm):

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm -r test
pnpm --filter runeicons-react test
```

`pnpm -r test` also runs the build steps of `runeicons-vscode` and `runeicons-figma`, because their test scripts build first.

The standalone packages run their own commands:

- `runeicons-flutter`: `cd packages/runeicons-flutter && flutter test`
- `runeicons-react-native`: `cd packages/runeicons-react-native && yarn install && yarn typecheck && yarn lint`. It has no `test` script.

The web deploy does not include this directory: `.vercelignore` excludes `/packages`.
